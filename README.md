# Resizer two

Small libary allows you to resize width or height or two elements with a resizer

Design:

- Used for onyl to elements
- Apply to a parent wrapper fo two elements
- Offers a handle to resize the flex of the two

Will not do:

- Hanbdle multiple chidren. Designed for two elements - you can make multiple clases in diffrent areas or components and use them in
  conjunction to get multiple resize areas that play with each other but the libary itself is aimed at two elements
